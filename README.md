# School District Analysis with Pandas

## Purpose

Maria, the chief data scientist for the city school district, needs help analyzing all the standardized test data across different schools. She needs this work to be reported and presented in order to help provide insights about performance trends and patterns that will inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level. It is particularly important to analyze the students' standardized test scores in relation to grade level, school, school type, and school budget. I will be performing this analysis in the Student_Data_Challenge_Starter_Code Jupyter Notebook file.
